Coming soon.

## Setup
* Fill in the template in src/set_env.sh with your database credentials and host details.
* Run `sudo set_env.sh` on the command line. You should only need to do this once.
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the top level of the repository.
* Run `python setup.py install`.
* Run `pytest -s` to run the test suite. If the tests pass, then you're successfully connected to the database!
