## About
This research uses data from The Eviction Lab at Princeton University, a project directed by Matthew Desmond and designed by Ashley Gromis, Lavar Edmonds, James Hendrickson, Katie Krywokulski, Lillian Leung, and Adam Porton. The Eviction Lab is funded by the JPB, Gates, and Ford Foundations as well as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. More information is found at evictionlab.org.

## Setup
* Fill in the template in src/set_env.sh with your database credentials and host details.
* Run `sudo sh set_env.sh` on the command line. You should only need to do this once.
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the top level of the repository.
* Run `python setup.py install`.
* Run `pytest -s` to run the test suite. If the tests pass, then you're successfully connected to the database!
